    "# Data Validation\n",
    "\n",
    "Data validation is having checks in place to make sure that data comes in the format and specifications that we expect. As data pipelines become more interconnected, the chance of changes unintentionally breaking other pipelines also increases. Validations are used to guarantee that upstream changes will not break the integrity of downstream data operations. They serve as a contract for the requirements that data collection or transformation must uphold.\n",
    "\n",
    "Common data validation patterns include checking for NULL values or checking DataFrame shape to ensure transformations don’t drop any records. Other frequently used operations are checking for column existence and schema. Using data validation avoids silent failures of data processes where everything will run successfully but provide inaccurate results. \n",

    "There are a couple things that using Fugue provides when it comes to validation:\n",
    "* Allows validation code to be reused for both Pandas and Spark projects\n",

    "* Simple interface for validation on each partition of data\n",

In pandas semantics, it would be the equivalent of `groupby-validate`.\n",

Even though we demoed with Pandera here, this will work with other data validation libraries as long as the classes are serializeable.\n",

When dealing with big data, there are normally logical groupings that require slightly different validation rules.
